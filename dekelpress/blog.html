<P>Build a Better Mousetrap</P>
<P>July 4, 2018</P>
<P> 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Build a better mousetrap and they will beat a path to your
door&quot; goes the old adage. Or, as the ghost of Shoeless Joe
Jackson tells the farmer in the movie &quot;Field of Dreams,&quot;
&quot;Build it and they will come.&quot; This is the American Dream,
the Manifest Destiny that propelled entire populations across the sea
and across the continent.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Of course, to paraphrase Mark Twain, rumors of the death of that
dream have been greatly exaggerated, but that does not mean that
there is no cause for concern. As for the doctrine of Manifest
Destiny, the flip side was manifest exploitation and greed. And as
for the better mousetrap, almost all the paths to almost all the
doors are either owned or demarcated by monopolies or near
monopolies. 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>On this American Independence Day I read an article in the
Atlantic Monthly by Robinson Meyer entitled &quot;The Trust Buster.&quot;
Lina Khan is a young, fairly recent law school graduate who was hired
by a think-tank to study monopolies in the present age. The Sherman
Antitrust Act, passed by Congress in 1890, states: &quot;Every person
who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or
conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of
the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign
nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony [. . . ]&quot; 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In the spirit of deregulation and in this Age of Consumerism when
the only concern is pricing, certain corporations have been allowed
to restrain trade by artificially lowering prices to drive out
competition, creating mergers and acquisitions that reduce market
competition and other practices outlawed by  antitrust law. Lina Khan
specifically calls out Amazon as the prime example. She proposes that
Amazon and other similar companies make America less free. &quot;Amazon
has disrupted the business model of publishing. Publishers used to be
able to take risks with the heavier books (not in pounds but ideas)
that might not be as popular, and they used to be able to subsidize
them with best sellers.&quot; In terms of job losses in the retail
sector, taxpayer subsidies, and the ripple effect in several
industries, Amazon has cost the American economy billions of dollars,
while presenting itself as the champion of the little guy, the
promoter of independent publishers and creators. Of course, it is not
the only example.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>What it boils down to is the balance between local and national
and global interests. Yes, efficiency and economies of scale are
worthwhile considerations in business, but there is also much to be
gained from the local perspective. I write this as the spectators are
arriving outside my window for the July 4th parade in Stanwood,
Washington. A national poll revealed that while trust has broken down
on the national political level, it is much higher on the local
level, where neighbors or family must greet or acknowledge or even
love one another. While on the national scene, it reminds me of the
time of the destruction of the second temple in Jerusalem, which is
attributed to causeless hatred or, a better translation would be
&quot;free-floating hatred.&quot;</P>

<P>Why Crosss-Genre</P>
<P>April 10, 2018</P>
<P> 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Genres serve a purpose. They provide form, structure, familiarity,
and help us choose our radio stations, books, and curate our
experience. From a marketing point of view, they help to target an
audience. The Dewey Decimal System, introduced in 1876, bought a
scientific form of classification to libraries. Science itself was
separated into strict categories. These boundaries were seen as
modern.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Prior to the modern age, people were not so punctilious about
genres. We still refer to Renaissance people as those whose interests
and talents transcend a single area. Regarding the actual
Renaissance, the notebooks of Da Vinci, for example, contained
writings and drawings about architecture, science, music,
mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy,
and botany. The Bible is a library in itself containing history,
myth, poetry, epigrams, song lyrics, and law compiled into a single
bound volume.      
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>This present age is in many ways no longer a time for &ldquo;either-or&rdquo;
but for &ldquo;both-and.&rdquo;  This approach can get us out of the
rut, whether musical, literary, religious, or political. Cross-genre
is one step beyond mixed-media, which has always been the American
art form because of our pluralistic composition.</P>
