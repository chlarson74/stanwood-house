			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Don't be an artist if you have any other
			choice.<BR>Don't become a poet unless you've found your
			voice.<BR>Certain jobs are not a living but they are a life<BR>Which
			you create day by day with a brush and palette knife.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The poets once were prophets and they did a show and
			tell.<BR>Ezekiel had to bake his bread on cow dung, with the
			smell,<BR>Lying on one side for thirteen months; it was
			performance art.<BR>Why would anyone volunteer to take on such a
			part?</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Moses himself argued he was slow of speech and
			tongue.<BR>Jeremiah begged off saying he was much too young.<BR>Hosea
			was commanded to go take a whoring wife.<BR>A prophet's job was
			not a picnic, not an easy life.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>God told Jonah to go and preach to a certain city<BR>If
			they turned from their wicked ways, then He would show them pity. 
			                                                               
			Jonah didn't realize, it was an offer he couldn't refuse.<BR>He
			tried to run, he tried to hide, he tried to take a snooze.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The long and short of the story goes, they throw him
			overboard<BR>He gets swallowed by a big fish and then he seeks the
			Lord,<BR>His words preserved in poetry, two thousand years and
			more.<BR>The fish gets indigestion and spits him on the shore.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Sometimes you must get swallowed before you find
			your voice.                                                       
			             Sometimes you think your destiny is strictly your own
			choice      <BR>There's many a slip twixt cup and lip especially
			for a fish.<BR>Though choice and chance each play a part, be
			careful what you wish.</P>
