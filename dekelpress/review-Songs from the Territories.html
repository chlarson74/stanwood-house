<P STYLE="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2in"><FONT SIZE=4>Review
from Kota Press</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2in"><FONT SIZE=4>We met
many people at the Washington State Poets Association conference last
month, and we also found many wonderful books of poetry at the book
fair there. One of the books I picked up was the collection from
Chaim Bezalel called &quot;Songs from the Territories&quot; which
includes photography, poetry, and narrative prose. This is a most
interesting collection!</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2in"><FONT SIZE=4>The
photography is stunning. In particular, there is a photo from a
Turkish Bath in Acco that is amazing. And there are some very
interesting pieces that are reproductions of tv and film media in the
Middle East. The poetry has historical and personal tinges that blend
seamlessly to tell us the story of one person finding his way through
this maze of life. And yet the poetic narrative is larger than one
person, too. One of the pieces from the section &quot;Prison Camp #7,
Negev Desert&quot; stuck out and stuck with me for days after reading
it:</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2in"><FONT SIZE=4>It may
just be that my everyday work is in the grief and healing world, but
that line, &quot;...every lie must come to grief...&quot; seems to
apply to every situation I've encountered in the weeks since I first
read it! And this book is full of works like this. In the &quot;Workaday
Verse&quot; section, there are so many pieces that speak truth with a
sense of humor-- any working artist will appreciate these.
Specifically, my favorites are &quot;Hack&quot; and &quot;The Unknown
Poet&quot; -- &quot;Ode to Commerce&quot; is also very poignant!</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2in"><FONT SIZE=4>Bezalel's
narrative prose in the section &quot;Observations on the Border&quot;
is not to be missed either. I've read this section at least three
times now, once outloud. My wheels were spinning so fast after
reading the first time that I actually penned my own piece using a
line from this as an epigram (see page 18 of the Poetry Journal this
month May 2002). Bezalel has led a most interesting life and the
accounts in this &quot;Observations...&quot; section are woven with
politics, religion, and common sense in a way that is most
compelling.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2in"><FONT SIZE=4>This
collection is a must read for any working poet! You'll find
idea-prompters, well-crafted poems, creative photography, and more
here. Get your hands on a copy today.</FONT></P>
