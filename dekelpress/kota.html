<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Songs from the Territories</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">by Chaim Bezalel</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">ISBN 0-595-13694-X</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">from Dekel Press</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">We met many people at the Washington State Poets
Association conference last month, and we also found many wonderful books
of poetry at the book fair there. One of the books I picked up was the
collection from Chaim Bezalel called "Songs from the Territories" which
includes photography, poetry, and narrative prose. This is a most interesting
collection!</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The photography is stunning. In particular, there
is a photo from a Turkish Bath in Acco that is amazing. And there are some
very interesting pieces that are reproductions of tv and film media in
the Middle East. The poetry has historical and personal tinges that blend
seamlessly to tell us the story of one person finding his way through this
maze of life. And yet the poetic narrative is larger than one person, too.
One of the pieces from the section "Prison Camp #7, Negev Desert" stuck
out and stuck with me for days after reading it:</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">How willingly we suspend our disbelief</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Like Don Quixote for his blessed whore,</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">In his eyes virgin evermore.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">But every lie must come to grief.</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">It may just be that my everyday work is in the
grief and healing world, but that line, "...every lie must come to grief..."
seems to apply to every situation I've encountered in the weeks since I
first read it! And this book is full of works like this. In the "Workaday
Verse" section, there are so many pieces that speak truth with a sense
of humor-- any working artist will appreciate these. Specifically, my favorites
are "Hack" and "The Unknown Poet" -- "Ode to Commerce" is also very poignant!</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Bezalel's narrative prose in the section "Observations
on the Border" is not to be missed either. I've read this section at least
three times now, once outloud. My wheels were spinning so fast after reading
the first time that I actually penned my own piece using a line from this
as an epigram (see page 18 of the Poetry Journal this month May 2002).
Bezalel has led a most interesting life and the accounts in this "Observations..."
section are woven with politics, religion, and common sense in a way that
is most compelling.</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This collection is a must read for any working
poet! You'll find idea-prompters, well-crafted poems, creative photography,
and more here. Get your hands on a copy today.</font></blockquote>
